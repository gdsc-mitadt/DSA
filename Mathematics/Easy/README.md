### Question 1
Given a series 9, 33, 73, 129...  Find the n-th term of the series.
Input: n = 4

Output: 129

Explanation: 4th term of the 
series is 129.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
### Question 2
Given a street of N houses (a row of houses), each house having K amount of money kept inside; now there is a thief who is going to steal this money but he has a constraint/rule that he cannot steal/rob two adjacent houses. Find the maximum money he can rob.

Input:
N = 5 , K = 10

Output:
30

Explanation:
The Robber can rob from the first, third
and fifth houses which will result in 30.

Input:
N = 2 , K = 12

Output:
12

Explanation:
The Robber can only rob from the first
or second which will result in 12.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

### Question 3
Given an array arr[] of size N, the task is to add the minimum number(should be greater than 0) to the array so that the sum of the array becomes even

Input: N = 8
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Output:  2

Explanation:  Sum of array is 36, so 
we add minimum number 2 to make the 
sum even.

Input: N = 9
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Output:  1

Expected Time Complexity: O(N). 
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
### Question 4
Given two integer numbers a and b, the task is to find count of all common divisors of given numbers.
Input: a = 12, b = 24
Output: 6 
Explanation: all common divisors 
are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.

Input: a = 3, b = 17
Output: 1
Explanation: all common divisors are 1.
### Question 5
Given a positive integer n, check if it is perfect square or not.
NOTE: don't use STL functions

Input: n = 35

Output: 0 

Explanation: 35 is not perfect
square because sqrt(35) = 5 but
5*5 !=35.

Input: n = 49

Output: 1

Explanation: sqrt(49) = 7 and 
7*7 = 49, Hence 49 is perfect square. 

Expected Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
