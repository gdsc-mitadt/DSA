### Question 1
Given a binary tree, find its preorder traversal.

Example 1:

    Input:

         1      
        /          
        4    
    /    \   
    4       2
    Output: 1 4 4 2 
Example 2:

    Input:

          6
        /   \
        3     2
        \   / 
        1 2
    Output: 6 3 1 2 2 

### Question 2
Given a Binary Tree, find the In-Order Traversal of it.

### Question 3
Given a Binary Tree, find the Postorder Traversal of it.

### Question 4
Given two binary trees, the task is to find if both of them are identical or not. 


Example 2:

    Input:

     1          1
    /   \      /   \
    2     3    2     3
    Output: Yes
    Explanation: There are two trees both
    having 3 nodes and 2 edges, both trees
    are identical having the root as 1,
    left child of 1 is 2 and right child
    of 1 is 3.
Example 2:

    Input:

      1      1
    /  \     /  \
    2    3   3    2
    
    Output: No
    Explanation: There are two trees both
    having 3 nodes and 2 edges, but both
    trees are not identical.
