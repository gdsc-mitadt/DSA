### Question 1
You are given N identical eggs and you have access to a K-floored building from 1 to K.

There exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= K such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break. There are few rules given below. 

An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
A broken egg must be discarded.
The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
If the egg doesn't break at a certain floor, it will not break at any floor below.
If the eggs breaks at a certain floor, it will break at any floor above.
Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

For more description on this problem see wiki page

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1, K = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: 

1. Drop the egg from floor 1. If it 
   breaks, we know that f = 0.

2. Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.
   If it breaks, we know that f = 1.

3. If it does not break, then we know f = 2.

4. Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to
   determine with certainty what the value of f is.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 2, K = 10

Output: 4


### Question 2
You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item.
In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
W = 4

values[] = {1,2,3}
weight[] = {4,5,1}

Output: 3

Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
W = 3

values[] = {1,2,3}
weight[] = {4,5,6}

Output: 0
