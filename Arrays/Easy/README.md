# Arrays Easy Questions





### Question 1

Given an array A[] of size n. The task is to find the largest element in it.
Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1, 8, 7, 56, 90}
Output:
90
Explanation:
The largest element of given array is 90.

### Question 2

Given an array arr[] of n integers. Check whether it contains a triplet that sums up to zero. 

Example 1:
Input: n = 5, arr[] = {0, -1, 2, -3, 1}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0, -1 and 1 forms a triplet
with sum equal to 0.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: No triplet with zero sum exists.

### Question 3
Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7, X = 2
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 4
Explanation: 2 occurs 4 times in the
given array.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 7, X = 4
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
Output: 0
Explanation: 4 is not present in the
given array.

### Question 4
You are given an integer N. You need to convert all zeroes of N to 5.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 1004
Output: 1554
Explanation: There are two zeroes in 1004
on replacing all zeroes with "5", the new
number will be "1554".

Example 2:
Input:
N = 121
Output: 121
Explanation: Since there are no zeroes in
"121", the number remains as "121".

### Question 5
Given an array of N positive integers where all numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find the exceptional number.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3}
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {5, 7, 2, 7, 5, 2, 5}
Output: 5

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
