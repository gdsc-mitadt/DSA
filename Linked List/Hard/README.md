# Linked List Hard Questions



### Question 1
Given Pointer/Reference to the head of a doubly linked list of N nodes, the task is to Sort the given doubly linked list using Merge Sort in both non-decreasing and non-increasing order.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
value[] = {7,3,5,2,6,4,1,8}

Output:

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation: After sorting the given
linked list in both ways, resultant
matrix will be as given in the first
two line of output, where first line
is the output for non-decreasing
order and next line is for non-
increasing order.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
value[] = {9,15,0,-1,0}

Output:


    -1 0 0 9 15
    15 9 0 0 -1

Explanation: After sorting the given
linked list in both ways, the
resultant list will be -1 0 0 9 15
in non-decreasing order and 
15 9 0 0 -1 in non-increasing order.


### Question 2
You are given a special linked list with N nodes where each node has a next pointer pointing to its next node. You are also given M random pointers, where you will be given M number of pairs denoting two nodes a and b  i.e. a->arb = b.

Construct a copy of the given list. The copy should consist of exactly N new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.

Return the head of the copied linked list.



Example 1:

Input:
N = 4, M = 2

value = {1,2,3,4}
pairs = {{1,2},{2,4}}

Output: 1

Explanation: In this test case, there
are 4 nodes in linked list.  Among these
4 nodes,  2 nodes have arbitrary pointer
set, rest two nodes have arbitrary pointer
as NULL. Second line tells us the value
of four nodes. The third line gives the
information about arbitrary pointers.
The first node arbitrary pointer is set to
node 2.  The second node arbitrary pointer
is set to node 4.

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4, M = 2

value[] = {1,3,5,9}
pairs[] = {{1,1},{3,4}}

Output: 1


Explanation: In the given testcase ,
applying the method as stated in the
above example, the output will be 1.



### Question 3
Design a data structure that works like a LRU Cache. Here cap denotes the capacity of the cache and Q denotes the number of queries. Query can be of two types:

SET x y : sets the value of the key x with value y

GET x : gets the key of x if present else returns -1.

The LRUCache class has two methods get() and set() which are defined as follows.

get(key)   : returns the value of the key if it already exists in the cache otherwise returns -1.


set(key, value) : if the key is already present, update its value. If not present, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the cache reaches its capacity it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting the new item.
In the constructor of the class the capacity of the cache should be intitialized.
 

Example 1:

Input:
cap = 2
Q = 2

Queries = SET 1 2 GET 1

Output: 2

Explanation: 

Cache Size = 2

SET 1 2 GET 1
SET 1 2 : 1 -> 2

GET 1 : Print the value corresponding
to Key 1, ie 2.

Example 2:

Input:
cap = 2
Q = 8

Queries = SET 1 2 SET 2 3 SET 1 5
SET 4 5 SET 6 7 GET 4 SET 1 2 GET 3
Output: 5 -1

Explanation:

Cache Size = 2

SET 1 2 : 1 -> 2

SET 2 3 : 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3 (the most recently 
used one is kept at the rightmost position) 

SET 1 5 : 2 -> 3, 1 -> 5

SET 4 5 : 1 -> 5, 4 -> 5 (Cache size is 2, hence 
we delete the least recently used key-value pair)

SET 6 7 : 4 -> 5, 6 -> 7 

GET 4 : Prints 5 (The cache now looks like
6 -> 7, 4->5)

SET 1 2 : 4 -> 5, 1 -> 2 
(Cache size is 2, hence we delete the least 
recently used key-value pair)

GET 3 : No key value pair having 
key = 3. Hence, -1 is printed.
